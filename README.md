# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to gain knowledge of the Moldex3D software, by producing a plastic reusable cup that is injection molded. In order to do so, a runner/gate system needs to be created with optimization as the goal

# Conclusion
This project helped me become familiar with the process of making multiple designs of a runner/gate system (screenshots of both designs included), as well as being able to use the data to decide which design is more fit. It also introduced me to the idea of high level research skills. This included going onto resin suppliers websites and deciding between many different materials. Research alone was a large part of this project, as it forced me to compare and contrast cost, appropriateness, melting temperature, strength, and many other factors.
